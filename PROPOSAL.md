(Track 1 - Problem Statement 2)
#### _"Rapid SOS / Providing immediate assistance during emergencies when the emergency services can't reach on time._
_Waiting for first responders to arrive is not always an option. When the situation gets dire, effective communication and support become essential to tackle the emergency. Can your innovation make a difference in these matters of life or death?_"

We believe it can.
Our species has endured 5 million years of life and the only way we've done this is by sticking together.

**Enter Obodo**. It can help tackle challenging, time-bound situations by leveraging our innate human desire to help those around us.

How it works:
1) Sign up to the app using our innovative OTP-only login system.
2) Register your location and other relevant information.
3) When in need, make a post to your circle!
4) Others in your area are notified and can choose to respond to your location.

A situation could be as minor as a cat stuck in a tree (something that needs to be dealt with and you need help for, but not necessarily needing to involve the authorities), or as major as a patient needing an ambulance but traffic obstructing it. At Obodo, we believe everyone deserves the chance to be helped in their time of need, to be a part of something larger than themselves and to give back to their community.
